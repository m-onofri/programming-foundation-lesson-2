# Question n° 1

# Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

# It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different
# objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change
# depending on what is done to that named-variable.

# In other words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it is not always THE SAME object.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

# Question n° 3

# Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see
# how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be
# different.

# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# After calling the method, the value of my_string variable remains "pumpkins"
# while the value of my_array variable changes from ["pumpkins"] to 
# ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"].
# When you call the method, you pass my_string and my_array as parameters
# (respectively a_string_param and an_array_param); inside the method 
# a_string_param is simply riassigned to another object ("pumpkinsrutabaga"),
# while an_array_param is mutated by the << operator.

# Question n° 4

# To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show
# a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the
# caller's version of it.
